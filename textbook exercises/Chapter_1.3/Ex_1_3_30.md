# 1.3.30

## Problem

Write a function that takes the first Node in a linked list as argument and (destructively) reverses the list, returning the first Node in the result. (Write both iterative and recursive versions).

## Iterative Solution

To accomplish this task, we maintain references to three consecutive nodes in the linked list, reverse, first and second. At each iteration, we extract the node first from the original linked list and insert it at the beginning of the reverse list. We maintain the invariant that first is the first node of what is left of the original list, second is the second node of what is left to original list, and reverse is the first node of the resulting reversed list.

```java

public Node reverse(Node x){
    Node first = x;
    Node reverse = null;
    while (first != null) {
        Node second = first.next;
        first.next = reverse;
        reverse = first;
        first = second;
    }
    return reverse;
}
```

## Recursive Solution

Assuming the linked list has N nodes, we recursively reverse the last N-1 nodes, and then carefully append the first node to the end.

```java
public Node reverse(Node first) {
    if(first == null) {
        return null;
    }
    if(first.next == null) {
        return first;
    }
    Node second = first.next;
    Node rest = reverse(second);
    second.next = first;
    first.next = null;
    return rest;

}
```
