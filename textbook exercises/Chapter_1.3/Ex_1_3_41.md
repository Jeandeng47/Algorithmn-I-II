## Problem
Copy a queue. Create a new constructor so that
````java
Queue<Item> r = new Queue<Item>(q);
````
makes r a reference to a new and independent copy of the queue q. You should be able to push and pop from either q or r without influencing the other. Hint : Delete all of the elements from q and add these elements to both q and r.

## Solution
````java
    // Initializes a new queue that is a copy of the given queue.
    public Queue(Queue<Item> q) {

        if (q == null || q.isEmpty()) {
            return; 
        }

        for (Item item : q) {
            enqueue(item);
        }

    }
