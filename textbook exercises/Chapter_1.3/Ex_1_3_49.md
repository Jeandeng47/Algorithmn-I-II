# 1.3.49

## Problem

Queue with three stacks. Implement a queue with three stacks so that each queue operation takes a constant (worst-case) number of stack operations. Warning : high degree of difficulty.

## Solution

1. Data Strcuture

- input Stack: Used to handle enqueue operations. New elements are pushed onto this stack.
- output Stack: Used to handle dequeue operations. Elements are popped from this stack. If output is empty when a dequeue operation is requested, we'll transfer elements from input to output, reversing their order in the process, which aligns them for proper dequeue order.

2. Operation

- enqueue(): We push elements onto the input stack, ensuring that enqueue operations are constant time.
- dequeue(): To dequeue, we first check if the output stack is empty. If it is, we refill it by reversing the order of elements in the input stack.
- Refill output: By transferring elements from input to output, we reverse the order of elements twice, effectively maintaining their original enqueue order in the output stack.
