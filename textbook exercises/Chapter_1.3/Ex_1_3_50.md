## Problem

Fail-fast iterator. Modify the iterator code in Stack to immediately throw a java.util ConcurrentModificationException if the client modifies the collection(via push() or pop()) during iteration? b.

## Solution

Solution: Maintain a counter that counts the number of push() and pop() operations. When creating an iterator, store this value as an Iterator instance variable. Before each call to hasNext() and next(), check that this value has not changed since costruction of the iterator; if it has, throw the exception.

```java
       @Override
        public Iterator<Item> iterator() {
            return new StackIterator(first, modCount);
        }

        private class StackIterator implements Iterator<Item> {

            private Node current;
            private final int expectedModCount;

            public StackIterator(Node first, int modCount) {
                current = first;
                expectedModCount = modCount;
            }

            // check that count has not changed since costruction of the iterator
            @Override
            public boolean hasNext() {
                if (expectedModCount != Stack.this.modCount) {
                    throw new ConcurrentModificationException();
                }
                return current != null;
            }

            @Override
            public Item next() {
                if (expectedModCount != Stack.this.modCount) {
                    throw new ConcurrentModificationException();
                }
                if (!hasNext())
                    throw new NoSuchElementException();
                Item item = current.item;
                current = current.next;
                return item;
            }

        }
```
