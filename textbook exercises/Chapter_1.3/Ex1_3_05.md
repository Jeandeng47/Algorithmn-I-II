## Problem

What does the following code fragment print when N is 50? Give a high-level description of what it does when presented with a positive integer N.

```java
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
while (N > 0) {
    stack.push(N % 2);
    N = N / 2;
}
for (int d : stack) {
    StdOut.print(d);
    StdOut.println();
}
```

## Solution

Answer: it prints out the binary representation of N.
When N is 50, the result is 110010.
