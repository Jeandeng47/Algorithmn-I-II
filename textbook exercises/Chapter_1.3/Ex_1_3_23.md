# 1.3.23

## Problem

Why does the following code fragment not do the same thing as in the previous question?

```java
x.next = t;
t.next = x.next;
```

## Solution

1. Explaination

- x.next = t. The next pointer of the node x points to the new node t. Now t is placed after x in the list.
- t.next = x.next. The line intends to linke the rest of the list by making its next pointer what's originally x.next. Since now x.next referes to t, this linke makes t.next points to t itself.

2. Correct Approach

```java
Node oldx = x.next; // store the original x.next
x.next = t; // insert t after x
t.next = oldx; // t points to original x.next
```
