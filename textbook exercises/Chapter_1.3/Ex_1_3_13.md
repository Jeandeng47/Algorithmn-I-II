## Problem

Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (queue) enqueue and dequeue operations. The enqueue operations put the integers 0 through 9 in order onto the queue; the dequeue operations print out the return value. Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur?

- a. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
- b. 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1
- c. 2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0
- d. 4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9

## Solution

1. Observation

- The queue follows the FIFO principle. Any dequeue operation will remove the element at the front of the queue,
- The sequence of dequeued elements must reflect the original enqueue order.

2. Algorithmn

- Create pointer. The pointer starts at 0, it represents the number to be enqueued from sequence 0-9.
- Iterate through the sequence.
  - Enqueue Phase. While nextEnqueue is less than or equal to x, enqueue numbers from nextEnqueue up to x into the queue
  - Dequeue. Check the front of the queue. If it matches x, dequeue its. If it does not match, the sequence is not possible.
