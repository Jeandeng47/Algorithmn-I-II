# 1.3.48

## Problem

Two stacks with a deque. Implement two stacks with a single deque so that each operation takes a constant number of deque operations (see Exercise 1.3.33).

## Solution

1. Data structure

- A deque (double-ended queue) supports adding and removing elements from both the front and the back.
- Stack 1 will use the front of the deque.
- Stack 2 will use the back of the deque.

2. Operation

- Push to Stack 1: add an element to the front.
- Pop from Stack 1: remove an element from the front.
- Push to Stack 2: add an element to the back.
- Pop from Stack 2: remove an element from the back.
