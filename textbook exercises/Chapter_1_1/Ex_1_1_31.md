## Problem

Random connections. Write a program that takes as command-line arguments an integer N and a double value p (between 0 and 1), plots N equally spaced dots of size .05 on the circumference of a circle, and then, with probability p for each pair of points, draws a gray line connecting them.

## Solution

1. Understanding the circle

- To draw N equally spaced dots on the circumference of a circle, we need to calcualte the coordinates of the dots.
- For an unit circle a radius 1 centered at the origin (0, 0), points on the unit circle statisfy the equation x^2 + y ^2 = 1.
- We could use cos and sin to calculate the x coordinate and y coordinate of a point where the angle intercepts the unit circle.

2. Math behind the circle

- Radians: The circle is 2\*PI radians. θ = 2 \* PI is 360 degree.
- Point distribution: to be spaced evenly, each point should be seperated by an equal angular distance, which should be given by θ = 2 \* PI \*i / N. θ increases linearly with i.
- Cos and sin:
  - x[i] = cos(2 \* PI \*i / N): this computes the x coordinate of the i-th point. As θ travels from 0 to 2 \* PI, cos(θ) gives the horizontal distance from origin to the point on circle.
  - y[i] = sin(2 \* PI \*i / N): this computes the y coordinate of the i-th point. As θ travels from 0 to 2 \* PI, sin(θ) gives the vertical distance from origin to the point on circle.
