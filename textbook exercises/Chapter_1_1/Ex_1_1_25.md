## Problem

Use mathematical induction to prove that Euclidâ€™s algorithm computes the greatest common divisor of any pair of nonnegative integers p and q.

## Solution

1. Induction Hypothesis

- For any q <= n, gcd(p, q) computes the greatest common divisor of p and q.

2. Base case

- When q = 0, the algo returns p, which is correct since gcd(p, 0) is p.

3. Induction proof

- Since IH is true for q <= n. We want to provide that IH is also true for q = n + 1. When q = n + 1, the algo outputs (q, p % q).
- Since p >= 0 and q <= n, by IH we know this algo computes gcd(q, p % q) correctly.
- Therefore, we only need to show gcd(p, q) = gcd(q, p % q). We do that by showing that the set of common divisors for (p, q) and (q, p % q) are the same.
- By definition we know that p % q = p - z \* q for some integer z, so
  (p % q) / k = (p - z \* q) / k = p / k - z \* (q / k)
- Since k is a common divisor of (p, q), p / k and q / k are integers. Therefore, p / k - z \* (q / k) is also an integer, which means both k divides both q and (p % q).
