## Problem

Expensive exchange. A clerk at a shipping company is charged with the task of rearranging a number of large crates in order of the time they are to be shipped out. Thus, the cost of compares is very low (just look at the labels) relative to the cost of exchanges (move the crates). The warehouse is nearly full—there is extra space sufficient to hold any one of the crates, but not two. What sorting method should the clerk use?

## Solution

1. Analysis

- Constraint: The cost of exchanging (moving crates) is much higher than the cost of comparing (checking labels)
- Selection: Selection Sort works well here because it guarantees that each exchange places a crate in its final position within the array (or warehouse, in this context).

2. Implementation

```
Output：
The original ship time array:
5 10 9 7 5 3 8 3 5 4
The selection-sorted ship time array:
3 3 4 5 5 5 7 8 9 10
Number of compares: 45
Number of exchanges: 10

The original ship time array:
5 10 9 7 5 3 8 3 5 4
The insertion-sorted ship time array:
3 3 4 5 5 5 7 8 9 10
Number of compares: 30
Number of exchanges: 30
```
