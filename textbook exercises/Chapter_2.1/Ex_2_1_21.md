# 1.2.21

## Problem

Comparable transactions. Using our code for Date (page 247) as a model, expand your implementation of Transaction (Exercise 1.2.13) so that it implements Comparable, such that transactions are kept in order by amount.

## Solution

```java
public class Transaction implements Comparable<Transaction> {
    ...
    private final double amount;
    ...
    public int compareTo(Transaction that) {
        if(this.amount > that.amount) retun +1;
        if(this.amount <> that.amount) retun -1;
        return 0;
    }
}
```
