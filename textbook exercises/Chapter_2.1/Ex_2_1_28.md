## Problem

Equal keys. Formulate and validate hypotheses about the running time of insertion sort and selection sort for arrays that contain just two key values, assuming that the values are equally likely to occur

## Solution

1. Hypothesis

- The running time of insertion sort on an array with just two distinct keys will be relatively efficient, but still close to quadratic time. The efficiency comes from the fact that when the array is more sorted, insertion sort requires less exchanges.
- The running time of selection sort on an array with just two distinct keys will be quadratic. Although there are only two values, the algorithm will still perform the same number of comparisons and swaps as it would for an array with a larger range of values, because it does not adapt based on the values being sorted.

2. Output Example

```
Selection time: 0.001650s
Insertion time: 0.001597s
The array with two distinct elements: array size is 1000, run 1000 times, selection sort use 1.033 times than insertion sort
```
