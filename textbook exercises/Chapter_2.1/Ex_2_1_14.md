# 2.1.14

## Problem

Dequeue sort. Explain how you would sort a deck of cards, with the restriction that the only allowed operations are to look at the values of the top two cards, to exchange the top two cards, and to move the top card to the bottom of the deck.

## Solution

1. Constraints

- You can only look at the values of the top two cards of the deck.
- You can exchange these top two cards.
- You can move the top card to the bottom of the deck.

2. Map to known concepts

- Bubble Sort Analogy: Bubble sort traditionally compares adjacent elements and swaps them to move the highest (or lowest) element to the end (or beginning). This principle is similar to the "move the top card to the bottom" operation.
- Circular Structure: Imagining the deck as a ring helps conceptualize the movement and comparison operations.
  - Keypoint: how to identify a cycle?
  - Moving the top card to the bottom after checking (and possibly swapping) the top two cards effectively rotates the deck, allowing every card to be compared with each other over multiple cycles.
  - Skipping a swap when the marker returns to its starting position prevents over-swapping and recognizes the completion of a full cycle through the deck.

5. Implement the iteration

- Compare and potentially swap the top two cards.
- Move the top card to the bottom of the deck.
- Repeat this process, keeping track of whether any swaps have been made in a full cycle.
- Conclude the sorting process when a complete cycle occurs without any swaps, indicating the deck is sorted.

```java
    // circular version of bubble sort
    public static void sortDeck(LinkedList<Card> deck) {
        boolean swapsMade;
        do {
            swapsMade = false;
            for (int i = 0; i < deck.size() - 1; i++) {
                Card topCard = deck.get(0);
                Card secondCard = deck.get(1);

                // Swap if out of order (top > second)
                if (topCard.compareTo(secondCard) > 0) {
                    // Swapping top two cards
                    deck.removeFirst();
                    deck.add(1, topCard); // Add topCard back after secondCard
                    swapsMade = true;
                }

                // Move the top card of the deck to the bottom
                deck.addLast(deck.removeFirst());
            }
            // Additional move to ensure circular comparison
            deck.addLast(deck.removeFirst());
        } while (swapsMade);
    }
```
