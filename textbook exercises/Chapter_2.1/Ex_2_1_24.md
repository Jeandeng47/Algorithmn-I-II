## Problem

Insertion sort with sentinel. Develop an implementation of insertion sort that eliminates the j>0 test in the inner loop by first putting the smallest item into position. Use SortCompare to evaluate the effectiveness of doing so. Note : It is often possible to avoid an index-out-of-bounds test in this wayâ€”the element that enables the test to be eliminated is known as a sentinel.

## Solution

1. Implementation

```java
    public static <T extends Comparable<T>> void insertionSortWithSentinel(T[] a) {

        int N = a.length;

        // move the smallest to the first
        for (int i = N - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if (less(a[i], a[i - 1])) {
                exchange(a, i, i - 1);
            }
        }

        for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
            T key = a[i];
            int j = i;
            // reduce exchange
            while (less(key, a[j - 1])) {
                a[j] = a[j - 1];
                j--;
            }
            a[j] = key;

        }
    }
```

2. Example

```
[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]

The first element 1 is the sentinel.

Sorting the Rest of the Array:

# i = 2: key = a[2] = 3
j = 2
Compare key 3 with a[j - 1] = a[1] = 4.
3 < 4? Yes, so we shift larger one to the right. a[2] = a[1] = 4.
Decrease j to 1.
[1, 4, 4, 2, 5]

j = 1
Compare key 3 with a[j - 1] = a[0] = 1.
3 < 1? No, so key is in the correct spot. Insert key (3) at j which is now 1. a[1] = 3
[1, 3, 4, 2, 5]

# i = 3: key = a[3] = 2

j = 3
Compare key with a[j - 1] = a[2] = 4.
2 < 4? Yes, so we shift larger one to the right. a[3] = a[2] = 4.
Decrease j to 2.
[1, 3, 4, 4, 5]

j = 2
Compare key with a[j - 1] = a[1] = 3.
2 < 3? Yes, so we shift larger one to the right. a[2] = a[1] = 3
Decrease j to 1.
[1, 3, 3, 4, 5]

j = 1
Compare key with a[j - 1] = a[0] = 1
2 < 1? No, so key is in the correct spot. Insert key (2) at j which is now 1. a[1] = 2
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

i = 4: key = a[4] = 5
j = 4
Compare key with a[j - 1], which is 4.
5 < 4? No, so no shifting needed. key stays in place.
The array is now fully sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

3. Output Example

```
Output:
Insertion with sentinel time: 0.002s
Insertion time: 0.003s
The array with random elements: array size is 1000, run 1000 times, insertion with sentinel use 0.723 times than insertion sort
```
