## Problem

Insertion sort with sentinel. Develop an implementation of insertion sort that eliminates the j>0 test in the inner loop by first putting the smallest item into position. Use SortCompare to evaluate the effectiveness of doing so. Note : It is often possible to avoid an index-out-of-bounds test in this wayâ€”the element that enables the test to be eliminated is known as a sentinel.

## Solution
