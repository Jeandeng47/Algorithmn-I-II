## Problem

Why not use selection sort for h-sorting in shellsort?

## Solution

1. Efficieny:

   - Insertion sort is efficient for nearly sorted arrays and can quickly move elements over short distances, which matches well with Shell Sort's progressively reducing gaps.
   - Selection Sort lacks this efficiency because it scans the entire unsorted section for each selection, regardless of the array's order.

2. Locality of Reference:
   - Insertion sort benefits from modern CPU cache mechanisms due to its operations on elements close to each other, especially as gaps reduce.
   - Selection Sort's wider scans can lead to less efficient cache usage.
