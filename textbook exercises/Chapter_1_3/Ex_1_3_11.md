# 1.3.11

## Problem

Write a program EvaluatePostfix that takes a postfix expression from standard input, evaluates it, and prints the value. Piping the output of your program from the previous exercise to this program gives equivalent behavior to Evaluate.

## Solution

1. Implementation

- Read input. Use a scanner to read inputs.
- Tokenize. Split the string into tokens.
- Process token. If it's a number, convert it to numeric type and push it to the stack. If it's a operator, pop the required operands from the tsack, compute the result by applying the operator. Then, push back the result to the stack.
- Output the result. Pop the final result from the stack, which should be the only item left on the stack at the end.

2. Considerations

- Type conversion. The stack store items of String. To evaluate the expression, we have to convert String to double.
- Error Handling. Consider to handle error like division by zero.
