## Problem

Write a stack client Parentheses that reads in a text stream from standard input
and uses a stack to determine whether its parentheses are properly balanced. For example, your program should print true for "[()]{}{[()()]()}" and false for "[(])".

## Solution
### Observation
A stack follows LIFO principle. Every time an opening symbol is encountered, it should be pushed onto the stack. Every time a closing symbol is encountered, the stack shoud pop one symbol. The popped symbol should match with the opening symbol.

### Algorithmn
1. Create a empty stack.
2. Iterate throught the symbols in the input stream.
- If it's opening symbol, push onto stack.
- If it's a closing symbol, check if stack is empty. If empty, return false. If not empty, pop the top symbol from the stack.
- Compare the poped symbol and the current closing symbol. If not match, the input is not balanced.
