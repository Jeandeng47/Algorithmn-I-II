## Problem

Ring buffer. A ring buffer, or circular queue, is a FIFO data structure of a fixed size N. It is useful for transferring data between asynchronous processes or for storing log files. When the buffer is empty, the consumer waits until data is deposited; when the buffer is full, the producer waits to deposit data. Develop an API for a RingBuffer and an implementation that uses an array representation (with circular wrap-around).

## Solution

1. Key characteristics

- Fixed size. The capacity of the buffer is determined at creation and cannot change.
- Wrap round. When the buffer's end is reached during data insertion, it wraps around to the beginning (if space is available).
- FIFO. Data is processed in the order it was added.
- Underflow or overflow.The buffer has states for being empty (underflow) and being full (overflow). Consumers wait on underflow; producers wait on overflow.

2. Data Structure

- Array. An array is efficient for a ring buffer due to its constant-time access.
- Pointers. To implement the circular nature, manage two pointers or indexes.
  - Head: Points to the first (oldest) element in the buffer.
  - Tail: Points to the next insertion point in the buffer.

3. API

```java
public RingBuffer<Item> {
    RingBuffer(int cap); // Constructor to create a buffer of a specific capacity.
    boolean isEmpty(); // Check if the buffer is empty.
    boolean isFull(); // Check if the buffer is full.
    int size(); // Return the number of items currently in the buffer.
    void enqueue(Item item); // Add an item to the buffer. Wait or notify if full.
    Item dequeue(); //  Remove and return the item from the buffer that was added earliest. Wait or notify if empty.
}
```
