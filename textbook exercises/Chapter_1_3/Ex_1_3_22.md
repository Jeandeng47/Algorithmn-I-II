## Problem

Suppose that x is a linked list Node. What does the following code fragment do?

```java
t.next = x.next;
x.next = t;
```

## Solution

1. Explaination

- t.next = x.next. The line makes the next pointer of t poinst to the node that is currently next in the list after x (assume it is y). Now t is linked to y and x is also pointing to y.
- x.next = t. This line changes the next pointer of node x to point to t. Now x is directly linked to t, and since t.next was already set to x.next (which was y), t points to y. This completes the insertion of t into the list right after x.
