## Problem

Write an iterable Stack client that has a static method copy() that takes a stack of strings as argument and returns a copy of the stack. Note : This ability is a prime example of the value of having an iterator, because it allows development of such functionality without changing the basic API.

## Solution
1. IterableStack Class
- Extends Stack<String> and implements Iterable<String> to support iteration. 
- The iterator() method is overridden to return the iterator from Stack<String>.

2. Copy()
- First iterate over the original stack to create a temporary stack to store reversed elements.
- Second iterate over the temporary stack to store the elements in corrected order.
