## Problem

Write a program that takes from standard input an expression without left parentheses and prints the equivalent infix expression with the parentheses inserted. For
example, given the input:

```java
1 + 2 ) * 3 - 4 ) * 5 - 6 ) ) )
```

your program should print

```java
( ( 1 + 2 ) * ( ( 3 - 4 ) * ( 5 - 6 ) )
```

## Solution

The Algorithmn is based on the Dijkstra's Two-Stack Algorithm.

- Create two stacks, one for values and one for operators
- When you encounter a number, push it onto the operands stack.
- When you encounter an operator, push it onto the operators stack.
- When you encounter a right parenthesis ")", pop two operands and one operator, combine them into a single expression with parentheses
- Push the result back onto the operands stack.
