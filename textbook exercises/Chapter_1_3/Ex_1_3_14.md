# 1.3.14

## Problem

Develop a class ResizingArrayQueueOfStrings that implements the queue abstraction with a fixed-size array, and then extend your implementation to use array resizing to remove the size restriction.

## Solution

1. Operation

- Queue follows FIFO principle, where elements are added (enqueued) at one end of the collection and removed (dequeued) from the other end.

2. Circular queue

- In a queue, especially a circular queue using an array, operations occur at both ends of the array.
- When a queue's underlying array needs resizing, and a circular queue implementation is used, there might be a need to "wrap around" the array.

3. Wrap around

- Efficiency: It eliminates the need for shifting elements.
- Space utilization: It makes optimal use of the available space, as no array positions are wasted.

```java

// Initial empty state, let's represent empty slots with spaces
Indexes:  0    1    2    3    4
Queue:   [/]  [/]  [/]  [/]  [/]


// Enqueued A, B, C; head is at index 0, tail (next insertion) is at index 3
Indexes:  0    1    2    3    4
Queue:   [A]  [B]  [C]  [/]  [/]


// Dequeued A, B; head is now at index 2, tail is still at index 3
Indexes:  0    1    2    3    4
Queue:   [/]  [/]  [C]  [/]  [/]

// Enqueued D, E, and then F wrapped around to the beginning
Indexes:  0    1    2    3    4
Queue:   [F]  [/]  [C]  [D]  [E]

// Formula to put elements in order in resized array
i = 0;
(first + i) % queue.length = (2 + 0) % 5 = 2
newQueue[0] = queue[2] -> C

i = 1;
(first + i) % queue.length = (2 + 1) % 5 = 3
newQueue[1] = queue[3] -> D

i = 2;
(first + i) % queue.length = (2 + 2) % 5 = 4
newQueue[2] = queue[4] -> E

i = 3;
(first + i) % queue.length = (2 + 3) % 5 = 0
newQueue[3] = queue[0] -> F

// original queue
Indexes:  0    1    2    3    4
Queue:   [F]  [/]  [C]  [D]  [E]

// new queue
Indexes:  0    1    2    3    4
Queue:   [C]  [D]  [E]  [F]  [/]

```
