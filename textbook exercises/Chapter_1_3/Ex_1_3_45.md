## Problem

Stack generability. Suppose that we have a sequence of intermixed push and pop operations as with our test stack client, where the integers 0, 1, ..., N-1 in that order (push directives) are intermixed with N minus signs (pop directives). Devise an algorithm that determines whether the intermixed sequence causes the stack to underflow. (You may use only an amount of space independent of Nâ€”you cannot store the integers in a data structure.) Devise a linear-time algorithm that determines whether a given permutation can be generated as output by our test client (depending on where the pop directives occur).

## Solution

1. Detecting stack underflow

- When will the stack underflow happen?
- Underflow happens if you attempt to pop from the stack more times than you have pushed onto it.
- Standard: if number of pops exceeds number of pushes, sequence will cause underflow.

```java
    public static boolean isUnderflow(String operations) {
        char[] operationChars = operations.toCharArray();
        // count = push - pop
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : operationChars) {
            if (c == '-') {
                count--;
                if (count < 0) { // Check for underflow immediately after each pop
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

2. Permutation generability

- Given a permuation ( arrangement of the numbers 0, 1, ..., N-1) generated by a sequence of push and pop operations on a stack.
- Example: Consider N=3, and we push numbers in the order 0, 1, 2. Here are a few possible scenarios:
  - Push 0, Push 1, Push 2, Pop (2), Pop (1), Pop (0) generates the sequence [2, 1, 0].
  - Push 0, Push 1, Pop (1), Push 2, Pop (2), Pop (0) generates the sequence [1, 2, 0].

```java
    public static boolean canGeneratePermutation(List<Integer> permutation) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int i = 0;

        for (int num : permutation) {
            while (i <= num) {
                stack.push(i);
                i++;
            }
            if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.peek() != num) {
                return false;
            } else {
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
