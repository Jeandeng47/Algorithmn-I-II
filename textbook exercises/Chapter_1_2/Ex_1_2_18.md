## Problem

Variance for accumulator. Validate that the following code, which adds the methods var() and stddev() to Accumulator, computes both the mean and variance of the numbers presented as arguments to addDataValue(): This implementation is less susceptible to roundoff error than the straightforward implementation based on saving the sum of the squares of the numbers.

```java
    public static class Accumulator {
        private double m; // the running mean
        private double s; // the running sum of squares fo differences
        private int N; // the number of data

        public void addDataValue(double x) {
            N++;
            s = s + 1.0 * (N - 1) / N * (x - m) * (x - m);
            m = m + (x - m) / N;
        }

        public double mean() {
            return m;
        }

        public double var() {
            return s / (N - 1);
        }

        public double stddev() {
            return Math.sqrt(this.var());
        }

    }
```

## Solution

1. Traditional methods

- var(): var <= S / (N -1)
- sdtdev(): stddev <= sqrt(var)
- Problem:
  - The var is computed as the sum of squares of differences from the mean divided by the number of values - 1.
  - Large sum: when N is large, the sum of Xi could be very large. When square the sum, increases even more, probably leading to overflow or round off errors.
  - Substraction: When computing xi - xm, if both xi and xm is large and close to each other, the subtraction can lead to loss of precision due to the limited number of significant digits that floating-point numbers can represent.

2. The addDataValue method

- Incremental mean update: m <= m + (x - m) / N
- Incrementally updates the mean with each new value
- Avoids the need to sum all data points explicitly each time
- Incremental variance update: s <= s + (N -1) / N \* (x - m)^2
  - Incrementally updates the sum of squared differences from the mean.
  - Avoids the need to square large numbers directly
