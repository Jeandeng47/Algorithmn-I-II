# 1.2.16

## Problem

Rational numbers. Implement an immutable data type Rational for rational numbers that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You do not have to worry about testing for overflow (see Exercise 1.2.17), but use as instance variables two long values that represent the numerator and denominator to limit the possibility of overflow. Use Euclidâ€™s algorithm (see page 4) to ensure that the numerator and denominator never have any common factors. Include a test client that exercises all of your methods.

```java
public static class Rational {
        public Rational(long numerator, long denominator) {

        }

        // sum of this number and b
        public Rational plus(Rational b) {
        }

        // difference of this number and b
        public Rational minus(Rational b) {
        }

        // product of this number and b
        public Rational times(Rational b) {

        }

        // quotient of this number and b
        public Rational divides(Rational b) {

        }

        // is this number equal to that
        public boolean equals(Rational that) {

        }

        // string representation
        public String toString() {

        }

    }
```
