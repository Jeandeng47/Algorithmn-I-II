## Problem

A string s is a circular rotation of a string t if it matches when the characters are circularly shifted by any number of positions; e.g., ACTGACG is a circular shift of TGACGAC, and vice versa. Detecting this condition is important in the study of genomic sequences. Write a program that checks whether two given strings s and t are circular. Hint : The solution is a one-liner with indexOf(), length(), and
string concatenation.

## Solution

If string s is "ACTGACG", and we want to check if "TGACGAC" is a rotation of s, we can concatenate s with itself:

```java
s = "ACTGACG"
s + s = "ACTGACGACTGACG"
```

Now, by searching for t (i.e., "TGACGAC") within this new string (s + s), we can determine if t is a rotation of s. If t is found within s + s, then t is indeed a circular rotation of s.
