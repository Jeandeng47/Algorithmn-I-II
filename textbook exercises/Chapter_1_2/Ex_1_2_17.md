# 1.2.17

## Problem

Robust implementation of rational numbers. Use assertions to develop an implementation of Rational (see Exercise 1.2.16) that is immune to overflow.

## Solution

Overflow considerations:

1. Overflow in operations: Check before operations if the result will overflow.
2. Simplification Using GCD: Always reduce fractions to their simplest form to minimize the risk of overflow during arithmetic operations.
