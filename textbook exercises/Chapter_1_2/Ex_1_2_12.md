## Problem

Add a method dayOfTheWeek() to SmartDate that returns a String value Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, giving the appropriate day of the week for the date. You may assume that the date is in the 21st century.

## Solution

Zeller's Congruence algorithm: Zeller's formula calculates the day of the week and returns a number from 0 (Saturday) to 6 (Friday).

```java
 public String dayOfTheWeek() {
        int m = (month < 3) ? month + 12 : month;
        int y = (month < 3) ? year - 1 : year;
        int q = day;
        int k = y % 100; // year of the century
        int j = y / 100; // zero-based century
        int h = (q + (13 * (m + 1) / 5) + k + (k / 4) + (j / 4) + (5 * j)) % 7;
        String[] days = {"Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"};
        return days[h];
    }
```
