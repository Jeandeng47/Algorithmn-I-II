# 1.1.24

## Problem

Give the sequence of values of p and q that are computed when Euclidâ€™s algorithm is used to compute the greatest common divisor of 105 and 24. Extend the code given on page 4 to develop a program Euclid that takes two integers from the command line and computes their greatest common divisor, printing out the two arguments for each call on the recursive method. Use your program to compute the greatest common divisor or 1111111 and 1234567.

```java
public static int gcd(int p, int q) {
    if( q == 0) {
        return p;
    }
    int r = p % q;
    return gcd(q, r);
}
```

## Solution

1. Pricniple of Euclid

- If d divides both a and b, then d also divides their difference (a-b) or the remainder whan a is divided by b (a % b).
- Since substarcting a multiple of the divisor from one of the numbers does not change what divides it, the largest divisor that can divide both numbers remains unchanged when switching to a mode b.

2. Result

```
Computing the greatest common divisor of 105 and 24
p = 105, q = 24
p = 24, q = 9
p = 9, q = 6
p = 6, q = 3
p = 3, q = 0
The greatest common divisor of 105 and 24 is 3

Computing the greatest common divisor of 1111111 and 1234567
p = 1111111, q = 1234567
p = 1234567, q = 1111111
p = 1111111, q = 123456
p = 123456, q = 7
p = 7, q = 4
p = 4, q = 3
p = 3, q = 1
p = 1, q = 0
The greatest common divisor of 1111111 and 1234567 is 1
