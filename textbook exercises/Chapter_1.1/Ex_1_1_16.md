## Problem

```java
public static String exR1(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) return "";
    return exR1(n - 3) + n + exR1(n - 2) + n;
}
```

## Solution

1. Recursive call

- exR1(6) calls itself with n - 3 and n - 2, resulting in exR1(3) and exR1(4), concatenating 6 between them and again at the end.
- exR1(3) will call exR1(0) and exR1(1), which returns "" and "11" respectively, thus exR1(3) returns "3113".
- exR1(4) calls exR1(1) and exR1(2), which return "11" and "2112" respectively, so exR1(4) returns "41112114".
- Putting it all together, exR1(6) concatenates the results: "3113" + "6" + "41112114" + "6", resulting in the final String "31136411121146".

2. Result

```java
The exR1 value of 6 is 311361142246
```
