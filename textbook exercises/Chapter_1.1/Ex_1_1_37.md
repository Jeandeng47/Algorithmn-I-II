# 1.1.37

## Problem

Bad shuffling. Suppose that you choose a random integer between 0 and N-1 in our shuffling code instead of one between i and N-1. Show that the resulting order is not equally likely to be one of the N! possibilities. Run the test of the previous exercise for this version.

## Solution

1. Result

```
M = 10, N = 10000

 1045  1000  1087   967   961  1037  1020   966   942   975
 1314   928   923   951   996   955   972   962   990  1009
 1199  1243   928   936   862   915  1005   934   969  1009
 1104  1178  1164   839   861   898   928   961  1051  1016
 1024  1088  1096  1221   891   898   882   935   965  1000
  930  1028  1055  1089  1205   884   900   921   995   993
  910   928  1030  1055  1118  1220   892   932   914  1001
  822   881   950  1038  1103  1097  1156   992   953  1008
  880   885   923   969   978  1069  1182  1183   961   970
  772   841   844   935  1025  1027  1063  1214  1260  1019
```

2. Biased shuffling

- When choosing between 0 and N -1 instead of choosing between i and N - 1, there are higher chance of choosing the same number multiple times during the shuffle. It can lead to certain element swapping back to original position.
- For a truly random shuffle, each element's final position should depend progressively on a narrowing set of positions, ensuring each permutation is equally probable.
