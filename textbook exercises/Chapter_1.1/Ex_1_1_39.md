## Problem

Random matches. Write a BinarySearch client that takes an int value T as command-line argument and runs T trials of the following experiment for N = 103, 104, 105, and 106: generate two arrays of N randomly generated positive six-digit int values, and find the number of values that appear in both arrays. Print a table giving the average value of this quantity over the T trials for each value of N.

## Solution

Result

```
N       Average Common Elements
1000    0.0
10000   110.0
100000  10567.0
1000000 670112.0
