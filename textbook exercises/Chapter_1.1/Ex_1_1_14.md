# 1.1.14

# Problem

Write a static method lg() that takes an int value N as argument and returns the largest int not larger than the base-2 logarithm of N. Do not use Math.

# Solution

1. Property of log

- For any integer N > 1, there exists an integer k such that 2^k <= N < 2^(k+1). This means that k is the floor of the base-2 log of N.
- We could divides the N by 2 until N become less than or equal to 1. The algo witll count the number of times N could be halved before it becomes less than 1, which is the definition of floor(log2(N)).

2. Implementation
   Refer to the code.
