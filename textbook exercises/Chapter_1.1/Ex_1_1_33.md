## Problem

Matrix library. Write a library Matrix that implements the following API. Develop a test client that reads values from standard input and tests all the methods.

```java
public class Matrix {
    // vector dot product
    public static double dot(double[] x, double[] y);

    // matrix-matrix product
    public static double[][] mult(double[][] a, double[][] b);

    // transpose
    public static double[][] transpose(double[][] a);

    // matrix-vetor product
    public static double[] mult(double[][] a, double[] x);

    // vector-matrix product
    public static double[] mult(double[] y, double[][] a);
}
```

## Solution

Refer to the code.
