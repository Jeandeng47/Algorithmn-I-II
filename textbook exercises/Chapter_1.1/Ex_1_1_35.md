## Problem

Dice simulation. The following code computes the exact probability distribution for the sum of two dics:

```

```

The value dist[i] is the probability that the dice sum to k. Run experiments to validate this calculation simulating N dice throws, keeping track of the frequencies of occurrence of each value when you compute the sum of two random integers between 1 and 6. How large does N have to be before your empirical results match the exact results to three decimal places?

## Solution
