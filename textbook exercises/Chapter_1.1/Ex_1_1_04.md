## Problem

What (if anything) is wrong with each of the following statements?
a. if (a > b) then c = 0;
b. if a > b { c = 0; }
c. if (a > b) c = 0;
d. if (a > b) c = 0 else b = 0;

## Solution

a. Wrong `if-then` syntax. It should not use `then`.
b. No parentheses around the condition `a > b`.
c. Correct. Braces could be omitted for block with only one statement.
d. Should ues braces around the statemnets of if block and else block.
