# 1.4.1

## Problem

Show that the number of different triples that can be chosen from N items is precisely N (N-1)(N-2)/6. Hint : Use mathematical induction.

# Solution

- Base case: Show that the statement is true for initial value of N.
  - The smallest number to start with is N = 3.
  - For `N = 3`, we have `3 * 2 * 1 / 6 = 1`. We have 1 way to choose 3 items out of 3.
- Inductive Steps
  - Assumption s: Assume the formula holds for an arbitrary positive integer k, the number of ways to choose 3 items from `k` items is `k * (k-1) * (k-2) / 6`
  - Assumption s': We need to show that this formula also holds for k+1. the number of ways to choose 3 items from `k+1` items is `(k+1) * K * (k-1) / 6`
