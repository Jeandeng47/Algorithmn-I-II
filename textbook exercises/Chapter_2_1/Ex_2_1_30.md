## Problem

Geometric increments. Run experiments to determine a value of t that leads to the lowest running time of shellsort for random arrays for the increment sequence `1,
⎣t⎦, ⎣t^2⎦, ⎣t^3⎦, ⎣t^4⎦, ... ` for N = 10 6. Give the values of t and the increment sequences for the best three values that you find.

## Solution

```
The array with random elements: array size is 10000, run 100 times, shell sort with t value 2.50 use time: 0.003310s
The array with random elements: array size is 10000, run 100 times, shell sort with t value 4.50 use time: 0.002630s
The array with random elements: array size is 10000, run 100 times, shell sort with t value 5.50 use time: 0.002810s
The array with random elements: array size is 10000, run 100 times, shell sort with t value 6.50 use time: 0.003350s
The array with random elements: array size is 10000, run 100 times, shell sort with t value 7.50 use time: 0.003730s
The array with random elements: array size is 10000, run 100 times, shell sort with t value 8.50 use time: 0.004530s
The array with random elements: array size is 10000, run 100 times, shell sort with t value 9.50 use time: 0.005990s
The array with random elements: array size is 10000, run 100 times, shell sort with t value 10.50 use time: 0.005300s
```
