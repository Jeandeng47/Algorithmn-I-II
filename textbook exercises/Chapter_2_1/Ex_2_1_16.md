## Problem

Certification. Write a check() method that calls sort() for a given array and returns true if sort() puts the array in order and leaves the same set of objects in the array as were there initially, false otherwise. Do not assume that sort() is restricted to move data only with exch(). You may use Arrays.sort() and assume that it is correct

## Solution

```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean check(T[] a) {

        T[] copy = a.clone();
        selectionSort(copy); // now copy is sorted

        for (int i = 0; i < copy.length; i++) {
            if (a[i] != copy[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
