# 2.1.8

## Problem

Suppose that we use insertion sort on a randomly ordered array where elements have only one of three values. Is the running time linear, quadratic, or something in between?

## Solution

The running time would be quadratic. Although the arrays contain only three distinct values, the growth in the number of comparisons suggests that the running time behavior is closer to quadratic than linear for large arrays in this case.

```java
Array size: 100
Comparisons: 1852

Array size: 1000
Comparisons: 168898

Array size: 10000
Comparisons: 16598263
```
